To-Do List

![Todo List Demo](gif.gif)


A simple, functional, and colorful To-Do List built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

This was one of my earlier projects, showcasing my foundational understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM), event listeners, and dynamic element creation.


âœ¨ Features

âœ… Add new tasks dynamically.

âœ… Mark tasks as completed.

âœ… Delete tasks with a smooth animation.

âœ… Filter tasks by All, Completed, or Uncompleted.

âœ… Responsive dropdown filter for easier navigation.

âœ… Fun falling animation when deleting a task

 What I Learned:

ðŸ”¹ How to use event listeners to handle button clicks and input events.

ðŸ”¹ Dynamically creating and appending DOM elements (like tasks) using JavaScript.

ðŸ”¹ Managing CSS animations based on element state.

ðŸ”¹ Practicing form handling and preventing default form submissions.

ðŸ”¹ Handling simple filtering logic to show/hide tasks.

Improvements to Consider:

Responsiveness: The design could be improved to work better across small screens (currently not mobile-friendly).

Persistent Data: Tasks could be saved to localStorage, so they persist after refreshing the page.

Accessibility Enhancements: Adding focus styles and ARIA attributes would make the app more inclusive.
